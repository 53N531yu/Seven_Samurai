/* Creative tilt (Aethestics):
- This is an endless runner set in a world that is powered by classical music. 
- The game takes place in the romantic caves, one of the many areas of this world.
- Run across this dreamy cave, which formed by the romantic motives seen in the music of multiple composers.
*/

/* Creative tilt (Technicalities)
- At first, you are not able to jump manually, so you must rely on bounce pads jump on platforms.
- You can collect jump pieces in this game. When you collect 3, you'll temporarily be able to jump manually and collect coins.
- Collecting coins will make the platforms and obstacles scroll by faster and faster.
